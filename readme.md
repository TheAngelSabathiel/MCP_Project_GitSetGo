## 3. Introduction
### 3.1 Purpose:
  
The fundamental purpose of this Technical Specifications Document (TSD) is to establish the definitive technical blueprint for the Parallox Airline Booking and Management System (P-ABMS). This document specifies the complete functional and non-functional requirements to guide the development team. The P-ABMS must be implemented on the specified MEAN/MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, and Vue/React) to create a modern, scalable, and efficient platform supporting Parallox Airline's strategy for direct customer distribution and operational efficiency.

### 3.2 Scope:
  
The scope of the P-ABMS is defined by the Customer-Facing Booking Portal and the Internal Administration Platform, with all data operations mapped directly to the provided Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD).

**In-Scope Functionality (WILL DO)**:
1. **Customer Transactional Core:** End-to-end management of the booking lifecycle, including flight search based on Airports.iataCode and date. The system handles the creation of the Booking document, linking it to Customers, FlightSchedules, and FareClasses. It includes processing Payments via an external gateway and managing AncillaryServices purchases.
2. **Inventory Management:** Real-time synchronization and tracking of seat availability for every flight instance via the FlightSeats collection, with strict consistency checks on the isAvailable status.
3. **Administrative CRUD:** Provision of an interface for authorized users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on core master data collections, including FlightSchedules, Aircrafts, Airports, and FareClasses.

**Out-of-Scope Functionality (WILL NOT DO)**:
1. **Legacy Systems Integration:** The system will not integrate with external Global Distribution Systems (GDS) or Departure Control Systems (DCS).
2. **Operational Logging:** No storage or management of operational data such as crew duty rosters, aircraft maintenance, or fuel planning logs.
3. **Financial & Accounting:** No complex financial modeling, revenue management, or general ledger (GL) integration. The Payments collection is strictly for transaction audit reference (storing the external transactionRef).

- **References**: List any documents or sources referenced.

### 3.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations:

| Term/Acronym | Definition |
|--------------|------------|
| P-ABMS | Parallox Airline Booking and Management System. |
| TSD | Technical Specifications Document. |
| MEAN/MERN Stack | The required architecture: MongoDB (Database), Express.js (Backend Framework), Node.js (Runtime Environment), and Vue/React (Frontend Frameworks). |

## 4. Overall Description
### 4.1 Product Perspective:
The **Parallox Airline Booking and Management System (P-ABMS)** is architected as a modern, three-tier, cloud-native application built using the **MEAN/MERN stack**. It serves as the airline’s direct sales channel and core inventory data repository.

**System Architecture Overview**

**1. Presentation Tier (Frontend)**  
- Built with **Vue.js** or **React**  
- Runs in the user's browser  
- Responsible for rendering the dynamic **User Interface (UI)** and handling user interactions  

**2. Application Tier (Backend)**  
- Implemented using **Node.js** with **Express.js**  
- Acts as the central **REST API**  
- Implements all **business logic**, request validation, authentication, and security controls  

**3. Data Tier (Database)**  
- Powered by **MongoDB**  
- Stores all application data using a **document-based model**  
- Utilizes document references to maintain the relationships defined in the **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**
