## 3. Introduction
### 3.1 Purpose:
  
The fundamental purpose of this Technical Specifications Document (TSD) is to establish the definitive technical blueprint for the Parallox Airline Booking and Management System (P-ABMS). This document specifies the complete functional and non-functional requirements to guide the development team. The P-ABMS must be implemented on the specified MEAN/MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, and Vue/React) to create a modern, scalable, and efficient platform supporting Parallox Airline's strategy for direct customer distribution and operational efficiency.

### 3.2 Scope:
  
The scope of the P-ABMS is defined by the Customer-Facing Booking Portal and the Internal Administration Platform, with all data operations mapped directly to the provided Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD).

**In-Scope Functionality (WILL DO)**:  
**1. Customer Transactional Core:** End-to-end management of the booking lifecycle, including flight search based on Airports.iataCode and date. The system handles the creation of the Booking document, linking it to Customers, FlightSchedules, and FareClasses. It includes processing Payments via an external gateway and managing AncillaryServices purchases.  
**2. Inventory Management:** Real-time synchronization and tracking of seat availability for every flight instance via the FlightSeats collection, with strict consistency checks on the isAvailable status.  
**3. Administrative CRUD:** Provision of an interface for authorized users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on core master data collections, including FlightSchedules, Aircrafts, Airports, and FareClasses.  

**Out-of-Scope Functionality (WILL NOT DO)**:  
**1. Legacy Systems Integration:** The system will not integrate with external Global Distribution Systems (GDS) or Departure Control Systems (DCS).  
**2. Operational Logging:** No storage or management of operational data such as crew duty rosters, aircraft maintenance, or fuel planning logs.  
**3. Financial & Accounting:** No complex financial modeling, revenue management, or general ledger (GL) integration. The Payments collection is strictly for transaction audit reference (storing the external transactionRef).

## 4. Overall Description
### 4.1 Product Perspective:
The **Parallox Airline Booking and Management System (P-ABMS)** is architected as a modern, three-tier, cloud-native application built using the **MEAN/MERN stack**. It serves as the airline’s direct sales channel and core inventory data repository.

**System Architecture Overview**

**1. Presentation Tier (Frontend)**
- Built with **Vue.js** or **React**
- Runs in the user's browser
- Responsible for rendering the dynamic **User Interface (UI)** and handling user interactions

**2. Application Tier (Backend)**
- Implemented using **Node.js** with **Express.js**
- Acts as the central **REST API**
- Implements all **business logic**, request validation, authentication, and security controls

**3. Data Tier (Database)**  
- Powered by **MongoDB**
- Stores all application data using a **document-based model**
- Utilizes document references to maintain the relationships defined in the **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**

### 4.2 Product Functions:
The **P-ABMS** provides comprehensive functionality, segmented into four key technical areas:

**1. Customer Transactional Core**
- Supports end-to-end management of the booking lifecycle.
- Handles flight search and real-time seat inventory display by querying the **FlightSeats** and **FlightSchedules** collections.
- Facilitates secure payment integration through the dedicated API service layer.
- Generates and issues the **PNR (Booking Reference)** once a booking is successfully confirmed.

**2. Data Persistence Layer**
- Manages and optimizes queries within the **MongoDB** document database.
- Stores, updates, and retrieves core data collections such as **FlightSchedules**, **Aircrafts** specifications, **Customers** profiles, and **Bookings**.
- Ensures data integrity across collections using cross-document references and transactional logic when applicable.

**3. Service Integration**
- Implements the **Node.js/Express.js** API for secure, high-throughput communication.
- Integrates with the external **Payment Gateway** to process financial transactions.
- Connects with an **Email Service Provider** to deliver customer notifications, such as booking confirmations.

**4. Administrative CRUD**
- Provides an interface for authorized Administrator users.
- Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for master data collections, including **FlightSchedules**, **Airports**, **FareClasses**, and **AncillaryServices**.

### 4.3 User Classes and Characteristics:
The system supports two main classes of users, with access rights enforced by the Express.js backend.

| **User Class** | **Characteristics** | **Authorization Level** |
|----------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Customer** | General public, focused on efficient self-service. Requires authentication to manage their own bookings and profile information. | **Limited:** Access restricted only to their own data (`customerId`). |
| **Administrator (Admin)** | Airline staff with operational responsibility, requiring full data visibility and modification capabilities. Authenticated through the internal Admin dashboard. | **High:** Full access to Admin-specific API endpoints. |

### 4.4 Operating Environment:
The operating environment is defined by the following required technologies:

| **Component** | **Technology** | **Deployment Environment** | **Purpose** |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------------------|-------------|
| **Runtime** | Node.js (LTS) & Express.js | Cloud Hosting (generic) using container orchestration | Executes the backend API and business logic; ensures high availability and scalability. |
| **Frontend** | Vue.js/React (HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap) | Static Web Hosting with a Content Delivery Network (CDN) | Provides a fast, responsive, and secure customer-facing interface. |
| **Database** | MongoDB | Managed Cloud Database Service | Stores all persistent data, indexed for high throughput and low-latency queries. |
| **Networking** | N/A | Load Balancer & Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) equivalent | Distributes traffic securely and ensures application resilience across multiple nodes. |

### 4.5 Authentication Procedure in Express.js
The Express.js backend implements a stateless, token-based authentication mechanism using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), ensuring secure and efficient API access.

| **Procedure** | **Description** | **Express.js Implementation** |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| **Authentication** | User logs in, and the system validates the submitted password hash (using bcrypt) against the `Customers` collection. | The `/api/auth/login` route handles credential verification. |
| **Token Generation** | When authentication succeeds, a JWT is generated and signed. Its payload includes the `userId` and `isAdmin` role flag. | The `jsonwebtoken` library is used to produce the secure, signed token. |
| **Access Control** | The client includes the JWT in all protected API requests. Middleware verifies the signature and enforces Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). | Custom Express middleware checks the extracted role against route-level permissions before executing the handler. |

- **Product Perspective**: Describe how this application fits into a larger system or context.
- **Product Functions**: Provide a high-level overview of the main functionalities.
- **User Classes and Characteristics**: Describe the different types of users.
- **Operating Environment**: Specify the hardware, software, and network environment.
- **Assumptions and Dependencies**: List any assumptions made and dependencies on other projects or technologies.

### 4.6 Assumptions and Dependencies
**Assumption:**
The data relationships defined in the ERD will be effectively modeled in MongoDB using a combination of references and embedded documents, with the Express.js application layer responsible for maintaining transactional integrity.

**Dependency:**
A fully documented, stable, and PCI DSS–compliant external Payment Gateway API must be available for integration.

**Dependency:**
A reliable email service API (SMTP or cloud-based provider) is required to send confirmation emails and system notifications.

## 9. Data Requirements
### 9.1 Data Models: Conceptual Overview

The **P-ABMS** utilizes a document-based NoSQL model (**MongoDB**), managing relationships primarily through references (`_id` fields) rather than strict joins. This approach optimizes read performance and horizontal scalability.

- **Core Entities:** `Customers`, `Bookings`, `FlightSchedules`, `Aircrafts`, `Airports`  
- **Transactional Entities:** `FlightSeats`, `Payments`, `AncillaryServices`  

This document-centric model contrasts with traditional relational (table-based) models but allows for flexible schemas and efficient storage of complex objects (e.g., a full `Booking` record containing passenger details).

---

### 9.2 Database Requirements (MongoDB Collections and Relationships)

The logical design is implemented via **MongoDB collections**. Relationships are established using 1-to-N references (storing the ID of the "one" side on the "many" side).

| **Collection** | **Description** | **Key Relationships (References)** |
|----------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| **Customers** | Stores user profiles and authentication hashes (`passwordHash`). | 1:N to `Bookings` (via `customerId`) |
| **Airports** | Master data for all served airports; indexed by `iataCode`. | 1:N to `FlightSchedules` (via `departureAirportId`, `arrivalAirportId`) |
| **Aircrafts** | Master data for aircraft types and seat configurations (`capacityEconomy`, `capacityBusiness`). | 1:N to `FlightSchedules` (via `aircraftId`) |
| **FlightSchedules** | Stores scheduled flight instances (date, time, aircraft, route). | 1:N to `FlightSeats` (via `flightScheduleId`) |
| **FlightSeats** | Atomic unit of inventory; tracks availability (`isAvailable`) and location (`seatNumber`). | 1:1 to a confirmed `Booking` (once booked) |
| **Bookings** | Core transactional record (PNR); stores passenger details and overall status. | N:1 to `Customers`, N:1 to `FlightSchedules`, 1:1 to `Payments` |
| **Payments** | Audit trail for payment transactions; stores external gateway reference (`transactionRef`) and final status. | N:1 to `Bookings` |
| **AncillaryServices** | Stores bookable extras (meals, luggage). | N:N to `Bookings` (via embedded array or linking collection) |

---

### 9.3 Data Storage and Retrieval

#### Storage Strategy: Document Embedding vs. Referencing
- **Referencing (Normalization):** Used for large, frequently updated, or master data entities (`FlightSchedules`, `Customers`). The system stores the `_id` and performs lookups at the application layer.  
- **Embedding (Denormalization):** Used for stable or frequently read data that is intrinsically part of the parent document (e.g., small passenger lists or ancillary selections inside the `Bookings` document). This reduces the number of queries needed.

#### Retrieval Strategy: Indexing for Performance
- **Primary Indexes:** `_id` field is indexed automatically.  
- **Search Indexes:** Compound indexes on `FlightSchedules` for flight search:  
  *```json
  { "departureAirportId": 1, "arrivalAirportId": 1, "departureTime": 1 }*
- **Transactional Indexes:**  
  Unique indexes on `Bookings.bookingReference` (PNR) to ensure fast lookup and enforce uniqueness (supports FEAT-007).
- **Security Indexes:**  
  Index on `Customers.email` to guarantee uniqueness and accelerate login validation (Use Case 2).


## 10. External Interface Requirements
### 10.1 User Interfaces (UI)

These requirements define the interfaces presented directly to users, built with Vue.js/React.

| **EIR-C01** | Real-Time Updates | WebSockets (or Polling) | Notifies frontend of critical, non-user-initiated changes (e.g., Admin delaying a flight). |
| **EIR-C02** | Database Connection | MongoDB Driver (Native) | Secure internal connection between Express.js backend and MongoDB. |
| **EIR-C03** | Health Checks | HTTPS / GET | Expose `/health` endpoints for Load Balancers and Container Orchestration monitoring. |


## 11. Glossary
This glossary defines technical and domain-specific terms used throughout the P-ABMS documentation.

| **Term** | **Definition** |
|----------|----------------|
| **Atomic Update** | A database operation where updates to one or more document fields are performed as a single, indivisible transaction. Critical for maintaining FlightSeats inventory integrity. |
| **bcrypt** | A cryptographic hashing function used by the Node.js/Express.js backend to securely store user passwords in the `Customers` collection. |
| **CRUD** | Acronym for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. The four basic operations on persistent storage, managed via the Administrator dashboard. |
| **DocumentDB** | A fully managed NoSQL document database service (e.g., AWS DocumentDB), often used as a MongoDB-compatible cloud-hosted alternative. |
| **Express.js** | Minimalist, flexible Node.js web application framework used to build the core P-ABMS REST API. |
| **JWT (JSON Web Token)** | Compact, URL-safe means of representing claims (user ID, role) between two parties; used for stateless API authentication. |
| **MEAN/MERN Stack** | Required technology architecture: MongoDB, Express.js, Angular/React/Vue, Node.js. |
| **PNR** | Passenger Name Record (`Bookings.bookingReference`). Unique identifier for a flight reservation record, crucial for retrieval (FEAT-007). |
| **RBAC** | Role-Based Access Control; used by Express Middleware to restrict API endpoint access based on user role (Customer vs. Administrator). |
| **Time-Limited Hold** | Technical mechanism (FEAT-008) that temporarily marks a `FlightSeat` as reserved during the payment window to prevent race conditions and overbooking. |
| **Transactional Integrity** | System ability to ensure data remains consistent and accurate, especially for multi-step operations like booking confirmation where both `Booking` and `Payments` records must succeed or fail together. |

### 12.1 Supporting Information: MongoDB Data Modeling Strategy

The decision to use **MongoDB** dictates specific data modeling choices:

- **Referencing for Master Data:**  
  Core entities that are updated frequently or exist independently (`Aircrafts`, `Airports`, `Customers`) are stored in their own collections and referenced using their `_id` in transactional documents. This prevents data duplication and simplifies maintenance.

- **Embedding for Passenger Details:**  
  Passenger-specific data (name, contact info) is embedded within the `Bookings` document. Since this information is static once booked, embedding ensures a single query can retrieve a complete PNR record quickly, supporting FEAT-007.

- **Concurrency Control:**  
  The atomic update feature of MongoDB is crucial for implementing the **Atomic Seat Hold** (FEAT-008) logic, directly supporting NFR-R03 (Reliability) to prevent double-bookings.
